EDC~110~Teaching in a Diverse World~4~This course is designed to engage students in both an examination and critique of their own schooling and education. It is meant to support students in developing a socio-political consciousness necessary for successful teaching in a diverse society (Ladson-Billings, 1995). Students in this course will be asked to come to a better understanding of their own desires to become educated people while simultaneously learning to critically examine the pathways and barriers that exist for students of color and other marginalized youth in schools today. Through participatory action research, students will explore a self-directed method of inquiry (problem-posing, problem solving) and hopefully learn how to claim their own education. ~None~None~Not Taken
