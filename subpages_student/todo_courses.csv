Course Number~Course Title~Credits~Course Description~Core Curiculum~Prerequisites
GST200~Quantitative Reasoning/Statistical Literacy~4~This course focuses on critical thinking about statistics and its use as evidence in arguments, with an emphasis on interpretation, evaluation, communication, and analysis of statistically-based arguments. Topics include association, causation, observational studies, experiments, risk, confounding, bias and chance. Common techniques involving statistical opportunism, conditional reasoning using English to describe and compare rates and percentages presented in tables and graphs, and the use of standardization to take into account the influence of confounders are reviewed. Emphasis is on interpretation, evaluation, communication, and analysis of statistically-based arguments.~Core Curriculum Component: None~Prerequisite(s): 1 of MAT105(Applied Algebra), MPL(Math Placement Level 3)
MAT163~Introductory Statistics~4~Concepts of elementary statistics, with an emphasis on working with data and understanding the role of variability. Topics include descriptive statistics, data visualization, confounding and causal associations, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, regression, and the use of modern computational tools in statistics. Students who have successfully completed MAT164, MIS379, PSY215, or SOC362 may not register for credit in MAT163.~Core Curriculum Component: Natural Sciences and Mathematics~Prerequisite(s): 1 of MAT105(Applied Algebra), MPL(Math Placement Level 3)
MAT164~Introductory Statistics for STEM~4~Concepts and techniques of elementary statistics, with an emphasis on working with scientific data and understanding the role of variability. Topics include descriptive statistics, data visualization, probability distributions, simulation, experimental design, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, analysis-of-variance, regression, and the use of modern computational tools in statistics. This course is designed for prospective Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics (STEM) majors or anyone interested in a more scientific introduction to statistics. Students who have successfully completed MAT163, MAT248, MIS379, PSY215, or SOC362 may not register for credit in MAT164.~Core Curriculum Component: Natural Sciences and Mathematics~Prerequisite(s): 1 of MAT114(Precalculus), MPL(Math Placement Group)
WST201~Introduction to Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies~4~This multidisciplinary course introduces students to the contributions of women in history, religion, literature, philosophy, sciences, and the arts, and how the questions and methodologies of these disciplines differ when seen from women’s perspectives. Students will also study the diversity of women’s experiences in terms of race, sexual orientation, and class.~Core Curriculum Component: Humanities~Prerequisite(s): None
WST315~Margins as Center: Feminist Theory~4~This multidisciplinary and multicultural feminist theory course focuses on the global voices often marginalized by the feminist canon. A variety of texts - including personal narratives, political statements, origin stories, and empirical studies - will be analyzed to highlight different theoretical approaches and multiple feminisms.~Core Curriculum Component: None~Prerequisite(s): None
WST399~Internship~4~~Core Curriculum Component: Augsburg Experience~Prerequisite(s): None
WST485~Senior Seminar~4~This advanced course will include student research and presentations that incorporate feminist theory. The seminar is required of all majors and satisfies the Keystone requirement. It is also required of minors who do not elect to do an independent study (499). It is offered at a different college each semester and may be taken in conjunction with WST 490.~Core Curriculum Component: Keystone~Prerequisite(s): None
